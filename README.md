Extra Flags for 4chan.
==========
Originally made for /int/, but we support /sp/ and /pol/ now as well.
Made by /ref/ and flags contributed by various /ref/ and /int/ posters.
Your flag not here? Create an issue on the right.

This is my modified version, which detects if a user is using a city flag and will display the corresponding regional flag as well as the city one. Same setup as the official one, so see https://flaghunters.github.io/Extra-Flags-for-4chan/ for guide. You only set one flag, so you can choose whether you use a city or a region flag.

Works with:
 - **Vanilla 4chan** (inline extension)
 - **appchan** (very ricy) https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x (**Bug:** JSON navigation prevents the extra flags from showing until you refresh!)
 - **ccd0's 4chan X** (ricy) https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x
 - **loadletter's 4chan x v2** (least bloated) https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x/
